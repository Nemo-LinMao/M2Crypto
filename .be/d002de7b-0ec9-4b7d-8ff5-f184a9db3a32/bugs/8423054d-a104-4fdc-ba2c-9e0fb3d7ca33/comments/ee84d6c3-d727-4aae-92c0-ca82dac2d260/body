MC: Aren't error message localized? Couldn't they be in non-ASCII encoding?
ERR_print_errors(3) says it returns ASCII text, but I am not sure how
much literally it has to be taken.

MV: I made a dump approach - called strings to libssl and libcrypto and try
to call str(line, 'ascii') on each line and did not find any error. As
far as I know error messaged of openssl are not localized, so this seems
to be safe to me.

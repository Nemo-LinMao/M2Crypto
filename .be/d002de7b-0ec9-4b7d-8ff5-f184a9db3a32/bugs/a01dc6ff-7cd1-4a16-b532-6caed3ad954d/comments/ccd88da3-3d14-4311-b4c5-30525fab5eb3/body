Concerning test_obj.py: str/bytes fixes [@l.21]
-----------------------------------------------

MC: OK, this is definitively suspicious: certificate values could
definitively be non-ASCII. Shouldn't we put below some non-ASCII text
like Michal Vyskočil or Matěj Cepl? ;)

MV: It can be indeed added, however in this particular case ascii
(ASN.MBSTRING_ASC) is expected in test. I would rather add this to TODO
as I have no idea how unicode/utf-8 works in openssl.

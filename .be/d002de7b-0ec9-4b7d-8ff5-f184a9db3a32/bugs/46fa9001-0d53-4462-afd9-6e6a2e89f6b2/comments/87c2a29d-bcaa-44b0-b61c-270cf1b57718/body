MC: OK, this is definitively suspicious: certificate values could
definitively be non-ASCII. Shouldn't we put below some non-ASCII text
like Michal Vyskočil or Matěj Cepl? ;) mvyskocil repo owner an hour ago

MV: It can be indeed added, however in this particular case ascii
(ASN.MBSTRING_ASC) is expected in test. I would rather add this to TODO
as I have no idea how unicode/utf-8 works in openssl.

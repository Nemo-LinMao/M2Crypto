 * https://github.com/abbot/m2crypto
 * https://github.com/pld-linux/python-M2Crypto (weird, but patches worth of investigaing ... is it just plain Fedora patches or something more? aaah, pld-linux)
 * https://github.com/tempbottle/M2Crypto/ (two commits worthy of investigation)
 * https://github.com/ajmirsky/M2Crypto/commit/67161643ce610de7fa50070128030f440949f0ea ... feels highly suspicious
 * https://github.com/mikedougherty/M2Crypto/commit/c96ae3fedf8c271535ace3855704c78e9383a373 ... sounds like having at least some thoughts behind it. Worthy of investigation
 * https://github.com/gooselinux/m2crypto/commit/564e978f5a0f37b7d0fd5ab22b469add55574405 ... feels like just an import of the Fedora src.rpm
 * https://github.com/boosh/M2Crypto/commit/844cb905db26c6788dc715be0005bd41110fe45f ... what's THAT?
 * https://github.com/Hypernode/M2Crypto/commit/b432d362223b2e2f5565dfb2eea799d10a419e22 ... another set of Debian patches applied, seems like having some merit (of course, we should start with the proper Debian patches).
 * https://github.com/Hypernode/M2Crypto/commit/53d5ac266cd40aeb45f53e485700409b8ff2191a ... not sure what's that
 * https://github.com/msabramo/M2Crypto/commit/ca805f533ea5180269398de0bdafcf297aa0b28a ... this could be actually a better solution to the Fedora include files being in "the wrong place" problem (originally from https://bugzilla.osafoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12970)
